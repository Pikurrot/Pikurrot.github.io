      "description": "Implemented a RAG system for a multimodal document question answering LLM, improving the performance of baseline models considerably on multi-page settings. I wrote a paper on it, which got accepted in a workshop at ICDAR 2025, and I will present it in Wuhan, China. I also did research on Mixture of Experts, and currently exploring new paradigms in the verification of multimodal Fake News."
